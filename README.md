## Here's an example program in F# that calculates a person's age and the number of days until their next birthday:

## This program will prompt the user for their date of birth, and then it will calculate current age, the day of the week you were born on, and the number of days until your next birthday.

## To use the program, simply run it in a IDE or code editor environment and follow the prompts.

# Version: 1.0.2
## An optimized version of the previous F# code: In this version, the DateTimeFormatInfo.InvariantInfo parameter in the DateTime.ParseExact method call has been replaced with null, which allows the method to use the default culture. This simplifies the code and makes it more efficient. Additionally, the getDaysUntilNextBirthday function has been optimized to use a single line of code to calculate the number of days until the user's next birthday. This eliminates the need for the nextBirthday variable and makes the code more concise. Overall, these changes should result in faster and more efficient code.


# Version: 1.0
## This F# version of the program uses functional programming concepts to make the code more concise and readable. The program is divided into several functions that each perform a specific task. The inputBirthdate function reads user input from the console, and the parseBirthdate function converts the input string to a DateTime object. The getAge function calculates the age of the user based on the birthdate, and the getDaysUntilNextBirthday function calculates the number of days until the user's next birthday. Finally, the main function calls each of these functions and prints the results to the console.
